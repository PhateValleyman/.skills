# ZyXEL NSA320 / FFP Administration

## 1. Purpose

This skill defines how to safely operate, maintain, debug, build software for, and modify the ZyXEL NSA320 running Fonz Fun Plug (FFP).

The NSA320 must be treated as **legacy ARM/uClibc production infrastructure**, not as a modern Linux workstation.

---

## 2. Server Profile

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Hostname | Confirm for the current task |
| IP | Confirm for the current task |
| Architecture | ARMv5 / Feroceon |
| ABI | soft-float |
| OS environment | Fonz Fun Plug 0.7.0 |
| Kernel | `2.6.31.8` |
| libc | `uClibc 0.9.33.3` |
| FFP root | `/ffp` |
| FFP Bash | `/ffp/bin/bash` |
| FFP home | `/ffp/home/root` |
| Toolchain | `arm-ffp-linux-uclibcgnueabi` |
| Native compiler target | `-march=armv5te -mfloat-abi=soft` |
| Go target | `GOARM=5` |

Assume limited CPU, RAM, storage I/O, and old kernel/userspace behavior.

---

## 3. Operating Principles

Default workflow:

```
OBSERVE → UNDERSTAND → BACKUP → CHANGE → VALIDATE → TEST → VERIFY → DOCUMENT
```

Never:

```
GUESS → MODIFY → HOPE
```

Rules:

- Inspect the actual system before making assumptions.
- Prefer the smallest possible change.
- Preserve compatibility with ARMv5, soft-float, uClibc, and the old kernel.
- Prefer reversible changes.
- Do not replace working system components unnecessarily.
- Never discard existing local work without explicit authorization.
- Treat storage, boot, firmware, and system-library changes as high risk.

---

## 4. Shell and Command Conventions

Generated shell commands must have an English comment immediately above each command.

Example:

```bash
# Check the running kernel version.
uname -a
```

Use:

- `/ffp/bin/bash` for FFP scripts.
- `#!/ffp/bin/bash` as the FFP Bash shebang.
- Absolute paths in scripts where practical.
- POSIX-compatible shell syntax unless Bash features are required.
- Traditional utilities when they are the available compatible option.

Do not assume the presence of:

- systemd
- journalctl
- modern GNU utilities
- modern iproute2
- modern Bash
- glibc
- modern OpenSSL
- modern kernel APIs

Check availability first.

---

## 5. Environment Discovery

Before any non-trivial operation, inspect the relevant environment.

Typical checks:

```bash
# Identify the running kernel and architecture.
uname -a

# Identify the current shell and executable location.
echo "$SHELL"
command -v bash

# Inspect available memory and storage.
free
df -h
```

For software operations also inspect:

```bash
# Check whether the required program exists.
command -v PROGRAM

# Check the installed program version when supported.
PROGRAM --version
```

Never guess:

- device names
- mountpoints
- filesystem types
- RAID layout
- service paths
- configuration locations
- installed packages
- library versions

---

## 6. SSH

Preferred authentication is SSH public-key authentication.

Typical connection:

```bash
# Connect to the NSA320 using the dedicated SSH key.
ssh -i "<user-approved-key-path>" <confirmed-user>@<confirmed-host>
```

Verify before depending on SSH:

- host/IP
- username
- key
- port
- network reachability

Do not weaken SSH security merely to make a connection work.

---

## 7. FFP Environment and Packages

FFP software normally lives below `/ffp`.

Inspect package tooling before using it:

```bash
# Check which FFP package managers are installed.
command -v slacker
command -v funpkg
```

Do not assume modern package-management behavior.

When changing packages:

1. Identify the currently installed version.
2. Check dependencies.
3. Preserve configuration.
4. Avoid replacing core libraries without understanding the impact.
5. Verify the resulting binaries and services.

---

## 8. Legacy Compatibility and Native Builds

Native binaries must match the NSA320 ABI and runtime.

Expected native target:

- ARMv5
- soft-float
- uClibc

Toolchain:

```
arm-ffp-linux-uclibcgnueabi
```

Typical compiler flags:

```
-march=armv5te -mfloat-abi=soft
```

Inspect binaries before deployment:

```bash
# Identify the binary architecture and ABI.
file ./program

# Inspect ELF architecture information.
readelf -h ./program

# Inspect runtime library dependencies when ldd is available.
ldd ./program
```

Common causes of failure:

- wrong architecture
- ARM hard-float vs soft-float mismatch
- glibc vs uClibc mismatch
- missing shared libraries
- incompatible dynamic linker
- unsupported newer kernel features
- compiler-generated instructions unavailable on ARMv5

---

## 9. Go Builds

Prefer static Go binaries for deployment where practical.

Typical target:

```bash
# Build a statically linked Linux ARMv5 binary.
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=5 go build
```

Verify the result:

```bash
# Verify the resulting executable architecture and linkage.
file ./program
```

Avoid CGO unless there is a specific requirement and the target toolchain/runtime is known to be compatible.

---

## 10. Storage and Filesystems

Storage operations are high risk.

Inspect before changing anything:

```bash
# Inspect mounted filesystems.
mount

# Inspect filesystem capacity.
df -h

# Inspect kernel-visible block devices.
cat /proc/partitions
```

Never assume:

- `/dev/sda`
- partition numbering
- RAID devices
- mountpoints
- filesystem type
- disk ownership

Explicit authorization is required before destructive operations such as:

- `mkfs`
- `fsck -y`
- `fdisk`
- `parted`
- `dd`
- partition changes
- RAID changes

---

## 11. File Deletion and Cleanup

Verify the exact target before destructive deletion.

Never blindly execute:

```
rm -rf /
rm -rf /ffp
rm -rf /etc
rm -rf /var
rm -rf /mnt
rm -rf /storage
```

Large files are not automatically unnecessary.

For cleanup:

1. Identify the exact path.
2. Determine ownership and purpose.
3. Check whether a service depends on it.
4. Back up important data.
5. Delete only the confirmed target.
6. Verify the resulting state.

---

## 12. Backup and Recovery

Back up important configuration before modification.

Important locations may include:

```
/ffp/etc
/ffp/start
/ffp/stop
/ffp/etc/init.d
/etc
service/application configuration
scripts
databases
```

Example:

```bash
# Create a timestamped backup of an important configuration directory.
cp -a /ffp/etc /ffp/etc.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

Backups must be usable, not merely created.

---

## 13. Startup and Services

FFP startup is normally handled through:

```
/ffp/start
/ffp/stop
/ffp/etc/init.d
```

Do not assume systemd.

For service changes identify:

1. executable
2. configuration
3. startup mechanism
4. running process
5. logs
6. dependencies
7. listening ports
8. required mounts

After modification, verify both startup configuration and runtime state.

---

## 14. Networking

Primary server address: `<confirmed-host>`

Legacy systems may provide:

```bash
# Inspect network interfaces when ifconfig is available.
ifconfig

# Inspect the routing table when route is available.
route -n

# Test basic network reachability.
ping HOST
```

Use `ip` only when it is actually installed and functional.

---

## 15. Network Services and Ports

For network services determine:

- process
- listening address
- listening port
- protocol
- configuration
- startup mechanism
- required firewall/network access

When available:

```bash
# Inspect listening TCP and UDP sockets.
netstat -lntup
```

Prefer LAN-only exposure when public access is unnecessary.

---

## 16. Logs and Diagnostics

Expect traditional logging.

Common locations: `/var/log`

Useful tools:

```bash
# Search logs recursively for a relevant term.
grep -Ri "TERM" /var/log

# Inspect recent kernel messages.
dmesg
```

Do not assume `journalctl` exists.

---

## 17. Kernel and System Resources

Check resource state before expensive operations:

```bash
# Inspect available memory.
free

# Inspect filesystem capacity.
df -h

# Inspect system load and uptime.
uptime
```

Avoid:

- aggressive parallel builds
- memory-heavy operations
- unbounded loops
- unnecessary background processes

Do not blindly use `-j$(nproc)`.

---

## 18. OpenSSL and Shared Libraries

Inspect the installed OpenSSL version before making TLS-related changes:

```bash
# Display the installed OpenSSL version.
openssl version
```

Never replace system libraries blindly.

When diagnosing a binary, inspect:

- architecture
- ABI
- dynamic linker
- shared libraries
- library versions

A library upgrade can break unrelated legacy software.

---

## 19. Scheduled Tasks and Locks

Inspect cron before adding scheduled jobs:

```bash
# Check whether the cron daemon is running.
ps | grep crond

# Display the current root user's cron jobs.
crontab -l
```

Scheduled scripts should:

- use absolute paths
- be idempotent
- log failures
- avoid overlapping executions
- fail safely

Use an appropriate locking mechanism such as:

- PID file
- lock file
- `flock`, if available
- atomic `mkdir`, when appropriate

---

## 20. MeshFS / SSHFS

The NSA320 participates in the MeshFS environment.

Before changing mounts inspect:

```bash
# Inspect current filesystem mounts.
mount

# Check whether sshfs is installed.
command -v sshfs
```

Verify:

1. SSH connectivity
2. target availability
3. mountpoint existence
4. existing mounts
5. duplicate mounts
6. `allow_other` requirements
7. boot behavior
8. failure/retry behavior

Do not create infinite boot-blocking retry loops.

---

## 21. Git and Repository Changes

Before modifying a repository:

```bash
# Inspect the current Git working tree.
git status

# Inspect configured remotes.
git remote -v

# Inspect recent commits.
git log --oneline -10
```

Never discard local work without authorization.

Do not use:

- `git reset --hard`
- `git clean`
- destructive rebases
- force-pushes

unless explicitly authorized.

---

## 22. Configuration Changes

Use this workflow:

```
LOCATE ACTIVE CONFIG → BACKUP → MINIMAL CHANGE → VALIDATE → TEST SERVICE → VERIFY RUNTIME
```

Do not edit an apparently relevant configuration file until you know that the running service actually uses it.

---

## 23. Verification

Every meaningful change must have an observable verification step.

Examples:

```bash
# Verify that the expected executable is available.
command -v PROGRAM

# Verify the installed program version.
PROGRAM --version

# Verify that the expected process is running.
ps | grep SERVICE

# Verify that the expected mount exists.
mount | grep MOUNTPOINT

# Verify that the expected configuration value is present.
grep -n EXPECTED_VALUE CONFIG

# Verify that the expected file exists.
ls -la FILE
```

Prefer verifying the actual runtime result over verifying only that a command completed successfully.

---

## 24. SSH / Service / Reboot Safety

Before restarting or rebooting:

1. Save configuration changes.
2. Verify syntax.
3. Verify required mounts.
4. Check running services.
5. Check active transfers/jobs.
6. Ensure SSH should return after reboot.
7. Confirm the change is recoverable.

After reboot verify remotely:

```bash
# Verify the server identity and running kernel after reboot.
hostname
uname -a

# Verify required mounts after reboot.
mount
```

---

## 25. Firmware Protection

Do not modify:

- bootloader
- kernel
- firmware partitions
- unknown flash/system partitions

unless the task explicitly requires it and the exact recovery procedure is understood.

Prefer making changes under `/ffp`.

---

## 26. Security

Default security posture:

- SSH keys instead of passwords
- encrypted protocols
- least privilege
- minimal exposed ports
- LAN-only services where possible
- no credentials in Git
- never copy private SSH keys unnecessarily
- avoid `chmod 777`
- avoid unnecessary root services

---

## 27. PC Independence

Routine administration should work from:

- Android/Termux
- SSH
- server-side scripts
- Git
- FFP tools

A PC should not be required unless a task genuinely depends on hardware/software unavailable through the existing environment.

---

## 28. Completion Standard

For software:

```
EDIT → SYNTAX CHECK → BUILD → TEST → INSPECT → DEPLOY → VERIFY
```

For configuration:

```
BACKUP → EDIT → VALIDATE → RESTART/RELOAD → TEST → VERIFY
```

A task is not complete merely because a command returned exit code `0`. The actual resulting state must be checked.

---

## 29. Compact Decision Tree

Use this before acting:

```
START
 │
 ├─ What kind of change?
 │   │
 │   ├─ Read-only / diagnostic
 │   │    └─ Inspect → diagnose → report
 │   │
 │   ├─ Software / binary
 │   │    └─ Identify arch/ABI/libs
 │   │         ├─ compatible → build/test → deploy → verify
 │   │         └─ incompatible → fix target/toolchain first
 │   │
 │   ├─ Configuration / service
 │   │    └─ Locate active config → backup → minimal edit
 │   │         → validate → reload/restart → runtime verify
 │   │
 │   ├─ Storage / filesystem
 │   │    └─ Inspect devices/mounts/FS
 │   │         ├─ read-only → proceed cautiously
 │   │         └─ destructive → explicit authorization required
 │   │
 │   ├─ Network / SSH / mount
 │   │    └─ Check connectivity → config → process → port/mount
 │   │         → test failure/recovery path
 │   │
 │   └─ Reboot / firmware / system-level
 │        └─ Backup → dependency/recovery check
 │             → explicit authorization → change → remote verify
 │
 └─ Any uncertainty?
      └─ STOP → inspect more → do not guess
```

## 31. Final Rule

Treat the NSA320 as legacy production infrastructure: inspect first, preserve compatibility, make the smallest reversible change, and verify the actual result.
